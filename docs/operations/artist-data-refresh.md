# Artist-data refresh operations

## Safety boundary

Discovery and refresh produce reviewable local artifacts. They do not write
to Neo4j, Supabase, or production storage. The graph status applier is a
separate command and previews changes unless an operator supplies
`--execute`.

Do not run paid Apify work merely to test this workflow. Unit tests cover the
classifier, actor-result classification, and stale-state transitions without
network access.

## Refresh sequence

1. Select and validate the explicit artist queue and approved spend cap. The
   tools do not fall back to a repository-local empty queue.
2. Preview `execution/apify_ig_enrich.py` for that slice, then pass
   `--execute --sweep-id <approved-id> --queue <path>` to authorize paid work.
   For the full queue or parallel slices, use the tracked
   `execution/enrich_all.sh` or `execution/parallel_enrich.sh` wrappers; both
   require those same gates and the parallel runner schedules every queue
   slice.
3. Review `refresh-audit.jsonl`, `refresh-status.json`, and
   `apify-run-report.json`.
4. Investigate rejected accounts and any newly stale handles.
5. Dry-run `scripts/apply-artist-refresh-status.mjs` with the status ledger.
6. Execute the status application only after the preview matches the review.
7. Host accepted images with `scripts/host-artist-images.mjs`.
8. Record GCS cost from the billing export alongside the captured Apify cost.

The refresh is retry-safe: stable artist IDs determine profile files and GCS
paths, and a sweep ID contributes at most one dead-threshold vote per handle.
A confirmed result can replace an earlier transient result in the same sweep.
Profile/quarantine/audit effects finish before their ledger checkpoint, with
deduplicated audit event IDs making a crash retry safe. Ledger/report updates
merge against the latest file under process locks, so parallel slices do not
overwrite one another. Rejected/dead local profiles are quarantined rather
than deleted.

Use the same `--sweep-id` for every process or slice in one quarterly sweep.
The cost report deduplicates Apify actor run IDs and accumulates their actual
reported usage under that sweep instead of overwriting the prior batch.
Potential spend is checkpointed before each actor POST and again when its run
ID/status becomes known. If a POST outcome is ambiguous, a run is non-terminal,
or a terminal run has no reported price, `apifyUsageTotalUsd` remains unknown;
the known subtotal and missing/non-terminal/ambiguous counts make the gap
explicit.

Supply `APIFY_TOKEN` through the process environment. It is sent as a bearer
authorization header and must never be put in command arguments, URLs, or
checked-in environment files. This applies to `discover_ig.py` as well as the
refresh runner; every paid discovery command also requires `--execute` and an
explicit valid queue.

## Status semantics

- `active`: resets the confirmed-dead counter, clears stale, and stamps
  `lastSeenAt`.
- `not_found`: confirmed dead observation.
- `private`: confirmed unavailable observation.
- `transient`: actor timeout, network failure, malformed response, or missing
  row. It is never evidence of disappearance.

Three consecutive `not_found` or `private` observations from distinct sweeps
mark the artist
`stale: true`. A transient observation breaks the counter but does not clear
an already-stale artist. Only a confirmed active profile clears stale.

Public roster and match reads exclude stale artists. No hard deletion occurs;
renamed, restored, or public-again handles can recover on a later confirmed
active refresh.

## Ownership boundary

Scraped data may update only:

- portfolio image URLs and their source/update metadata;
- the audited `looksBookable` verdict and `bookabilityReason`;
- `lastRefreshStatus`, `lastRefreshAt`, and `lastRefreshReason`;
- `consecutiveDeadRefreshes`, `stale`, and `lastSeenAt`.

It must not overwrite artist-managed profile values. In particular,
`artistManagedFields`, `profileManagedAtEpochMs`, immutable Instagram, and
`claimVerificationStatus` are outside the refresh write set.

## Scheduling decision

The quarterly scheduler remains intentionally unimplemented until an actual
full sweep has both its Apify and GCS cost recorded and an owner-approved
spend cap. Do not attach the job to the nightly crew runner.
