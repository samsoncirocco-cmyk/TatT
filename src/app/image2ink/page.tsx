 * The Image2Ink discovery door (TAT-46).

 * One page, served at image2ink.com's root via a middleware rewrite
 * (src/proxy.ts). Copy: docs/brand/image2ink-landing-copy.md. Rules:
 * docs/brand/two-door-brand-guide.md — Image2Ink is not a second brand,
 * there is no separate signup, and every CTA hands the visitor to
 * TattTester. Register: Loud (ADR-0032) — this is a marketing surface,
 * not a commitment screen.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wrapped in StudioShell: the shell is the product's
 * interior nav, and the door has no nav — the only ways out are
 * TattTester CTAs.

  {
    q: "What kind of images can I use?",
    a: "Photos, screenshots, sketches, art you love. Use images as inspiration for a style or subject. What you shouldn't do is copy another artist's tattoo line-for-line — your matched artist wouldn't ink that anyway, and neither would we help you try.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after I pick a design?",
    a: "Two things. First, you can test it: see it on your own body in AR and even wear it as a temporary tattoo before you commit — that part of the product is called TattTester, and it's where your account lives. Second, we match you with artists who fit the design, you pick one, and you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the design I pick exactly what gets tattooed?",
    a: "Almost — and that's a good thing. Your artist gets the design as a stencil and refines it: sizing for your placement, line weights that age well, details that work on skin instead of screens. You approve the final version before any needle appears.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to get the tattoo?",
    a: "Nope. Swipe forever if you want. Wear a design as a temp tattoo and change your mind. Booking only happens when you decide it does.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "You pay for design generation, and a booking fee when you book an artist. The tattoo itself is priced by your artist, like always. Early-access members get launch pricing — join the waitlist and we'll show you exactly what it costs before you pay anything.",
