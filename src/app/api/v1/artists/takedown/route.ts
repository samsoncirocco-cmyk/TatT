/**
 * POST /api/v1/artists/takedown — "this is my work, take it down".
 *
 * TatT re-hosts portfolio photographs for artists who never opted in. This is
 * how one of them asks us to stop. It is the sibling of /api/v1/connect/claim:
 * the same recognition moment ("this is my profile"), with the other ending.
 *
 * Deliberate properties (see docs/adr/0025):
 *
 *  - PUBLIC. No Firebase token. Requiring a TatT account before you may ask TatT
 *    to stop using your photographs would be backwards. Abuse is bounded by an
 *    IP rate limit and by the fact that this route cannot remove anything.
 *
 *  - REMOVES NOTHING. It records a `:TakedownRequest` and emails a human. It has
 *    no write path to GCS, Supabase, or the `:Artist` node. That is what stops a
 *    takedown request being a way to delete a competitor — no request, however
 *    convincing, removes anything on its own. A human runs the executor.
 *
 *  - NEVER FAKES SUCCESS. If ops could not be notified, this returns 502 and
 *    tells the artist where else to write. An artist who is shown a confirmation
 *    while the request evaporates is worse off than one who sees an error.
