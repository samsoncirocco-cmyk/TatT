/**
 * POST /api/v1/artists/reinstate — "you removed me, and now I want to come back".
 *
 * The counterpart to /api/v1/artists/takedown, and the only door through the
 * permanent tombstone that takedown installs. See docs/adr/0026.
 *
 * Deliberate properties:
 *
 *  - AUTHENTICATED, unlike takedown. Asking to be *removed* must be
 *    frictionless — requiring a TatT account first would be backwards. Asking to
 *    be *re-added* is the opposite: the account is part of the proof, and gives
 *    the eventual ownership binding an identity that can be revoked.
 *
 *  - CHANGES NOTHING. It records a `:ReinstatementRequest` and emails a human.
 *    It cannot clear `removedAt`, cannot bind `claimedByUid`, and cannot touch a
 *    `:TakedownTombstone`. Same restraint as takedown, for the same reason: the
 *    publicly reachable half of a dangerous operation must be inert.
 *
 *  - REVEALS NOTHING. The response is identical whether or not a tombstone
 *    exists for the handle. A tombstone records that someone exercised a removal
 *    right, which is itself sensitive; a route that confirmed them would be an
 *    oracle for "who asked to be taken down?". The code is always issued, the
 *    request is always recorded, and only the operator's dry run knows the
 *    truth. This costs nothing, because a real artist's next step is the same
 *    either way.
 *
 *  - NEVER FAKES SUCCESS. If ops could not be notified, this returns 502 rather
 *    than leaving an artist waiting on a review that will never happen.
