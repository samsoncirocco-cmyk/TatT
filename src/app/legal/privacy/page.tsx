            <H2>2.&nbsp;How we use it</H2>
            <p>
              To operate the service, generate and store your designs, match you with artists,
              take and settle bookings, and meet legal and tax obligations. We do not sell
              personal data.
            </p>

            <H2>3.&nbsp;Your rights as a user</H2>
            <p>
              You can see and update your profile in Settings. For everything else —
              a copy of what we hold about you, a correction you cannot make yourself,
              or deleting your account — contact us (section 9) and we will do it.
              Deleting your account removes your designs and your generation history.
              Booking and payment records are retained where we are required to keep them.

            <H2>4.&nbsp;Artists collected from public sources</H2>

            <div className="border-l-2 border-quiet/50 pl-5 py-1 my-6">
              <p className="text-quiet text-[15px]">
                We built TattTester&rsquo;s artist directory by collecting public information
                about tattoo artists from the internet rather than asking artists to submit it
                themselves. We have not identified opt-in records for that collected dataset.
                If we listed you without your permission, you can have it removed. Section 4.2
                tells you how.
              </p>
            </div>

            <H3>4.1&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;What we collected, and from where</H3>
            <p>
              As of July 30, 2026, our production directory contained roughly{' '}
              <strong className="text-quiet">18,000 artist records</strong> collected from
              publicly accessible sources: studio and shop websites, public artist directories,
              and public Instagram profiles. A record may include some combination of name,
              Instagram handle, studio or shop name, city and state, approximate location,
              tattoo styles, public ratings and review counts, and a link to the page where we
              found it.
            </p>
            <p>
              About 7,500 records have portfolio-image links attached, totaling roughly 68,500
              URLs. Most point to the website where the image was published. A small subset
              has been copied to TattTester storage: on the same date, our production data
              contained 26 TattTester-hosted image URLs across 6 artist records. Whether
              unclaimed artists&rsquo; portfolio images appear in the product is controlled by
              a server-side safety switch. We may also store mathematical representations
              (&ldquo;embeddings&rdquo;) used by our matching system.
            </p>
            <p>
              We did this so the directory would be useful on day one rather than empty. That
              was our commercial interest, not the artists&rsquo;, and we are naming it as such
              rather than describing it as a benefit to them.
            </p>

            <H3>4.2&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Your right to have it removed, and how to use it</H3>
            <p>
              You can ask us to remove you. You do not need a TattTester account, a lawyer, or a
              reason.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-quiet-dim">
              <li>
                Use the removal link on your profile page, which goes to a form at{" "}
                <span className="text-quiet">/takedown</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Or email us. Either way, tell us which profile is yours and how to reach you.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can ask us to remove{" "}
                <strong className="text-quiet">your photographs only</strong> and leave the
                basic listing, or to remove <strong className="text-quiet">everything</strong>.
                If you do not say, we remove everything.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Submitting the form does not delete anything by itself, and we will not tell you
              that it has. A person reviews every request. We do this deliberately: if a form
              submission could erase an artist, anyone could use it to erase a competitor. We
              will confirm to you when removal has actually happened.
            </p>

            <H3>4.3&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;What removal deletes, and what it does not</H3>
            <p>You are entitled to the exact answer rather than a reassuring one.</p>

            <p className="text-quiet pt-2">Permanently deleted:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-quiet-dim">
              <li>
                Every portfolio photograph of yours that we re-hosted. Deleted from our
                storage, not hidden.
              </li>
              <li>
                The style embedding derived from your work, so it no longer influences
                matching.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your name, biography, Instagram handle, studio name, location, ratings, review
                counts and portfolio links, which are erased from our database record.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your profile page, and your presence in search, browsing, recommendations and
                the homepage.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-quiet pt-4">Retained, and why:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-quiet-dim">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-quiet">An emptied database record.</strong> We keep a
                stripped record identified only by an internal ID, with the date of your
                removal. It holds no personal details. It exists because deleting the record
                outright would break links to any payment held in your name, and would destroy
                our own proof that we honoured your request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-quiet">Any payment record</strong> created by a client
                leaving a deposit for you. Where a client&rsquo;s money is involved we cannot
                simply delete the record; we resolve the payment first, and our removal tool
                refuses to run while one is outstanding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-quiet">A record of the removal itself.</strong> See 4.4
                — this one deserves its own explanation.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-quiet pt-4">What we cannot promise:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-quiet-dim">
              <li>
                Copies held elsewhere. Search engines, caches and content delivery networks may
                serve old copies of images for a period after we delete them. We cannot reach
                into those, but we can tell you what the URLs were so you can ask them
                directly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Backups. Our infrastructure keeps operational backups on a rolling schedule, so
                deleted content may persist in those for a period before ageing out.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <H3>4.4&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;We keep one permanent record so you are not re-added</H3>
            <p>
              Our directory was built by automated collection, and we may run that again. If we
              kept no record of your removal, the next run would find your public Instagram
              profile and add you back — and you would have to ask us again, forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              So when we remove you, we permanently record{" "}
              <strong className="text-quiet">your Instagram handle</strong> (and internal
              identifiers) on a suppression list that every collection process checks before
              adding anyone. Your handle is the only identifier that stays stable between runs,
              which is why we keep that specifically.
            </p>
            <div className="border-l-2 border-quiet/30 pl-5 py-1 my-5">
              <p>
                Being straightforward about the trade-off:{" "}
                <strong className="text-quiet">
                  this suppression list is itself retained personal data
                </strong>
                . We keep one piece of information about you indefinitely, for the specific and
                only purpose of never processing anything else about you again. We think that
                is the right balance, and it is why we are stating it plainly rather than
                leaving you to discover it. The entry holds your handle, the date, and nothing
                else — no photographs, no name, no location, no contact details.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              If you would rather we did not keep even that, tell us and we will delete it. We
              will also tell you honestly that we can then no longer guarantee a future
              collection run will not re-add you.
            </p>

            <H3>4.5&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Coming back, if you ever want to</H3>
            <p>
              Removal is not a ban. The suppression list stops{" "}
              <em className="text-quiet/90">us</em> adding you; it does not stop{" "}
              <em className="text-quiet/90">you</em> joining. If you later decide you want a
              TattTester profile, you can create an account and claim one deliberately.
            </p>
            <p>Two things are worth knowing before you do:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-quiet-dim">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-quiet">Nothing comes back.</strong> Your photographs and
                details were genuinely destroyed. You would start from an empty profile and fill
                it in yourself. We cannot undo the deletion, and we would not want to be able
                to.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-quiet">
                  Our automated collection stays blocked permanently
                </strong>
                , even after you join. Your profile is yours; a later collection run must never
                overwrite what you wrote with scraped data.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <H3>4.6&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Proving it is you</H3>
            <p>
              We have to be careful in both directions: a removal request must not be usable to
              erase a rival, and a request to take ownership of a profile must not be usable to
              take someone else&rsquo;s.
            </p>
            <p className="pt-1">
              <strong className="text-quiet">To have yourself removed</strong>, we normally ask

              posting a short code we send you, or messaging us from that account. If you no
              longer have that account, or never had one, tell us and we will find another way.
              We would rather remove someone on imperfect evidence than leave a real artist
              listed against their wishes.

              <strong className="text-quiet">To claim or reinstate a profile</strong>, the bar
              is higher, because a claimed profile can receive client deposits. We require an
              account, proof of control of the Instagram handle, and review by a person before
              any profile is bound to you.

              We are not able to establish who owns the copyright in a photograph. If an artist
              and a studio disagree about whose work a portfolio is, we cannot adjudicate that,
              and we will say so rather than pick a side.

            <p>
              We aim to acknowledge a removal request within a few days and to action it
              promptly after that. If you tell us your request is made under a specific legal
              right, say so and we will treat the applicable statutory deadline as binding.

            <H2>5.&nbsp;Texting with SketchBot (SMS)</H2>
            <p>
              You can run a design conversation over text message by texting SketchBot at
              the number published on this site. If you do, we collect your{" "}
              <strong className="text-quiet">phone number</strong>, the{" "}
              <strong className="text-quiet">content of your messages</strong>, and the{" "}
              <strong className="text-quiet">design requests</strong> you make in them. We
              use that information to provide the design conversation service: understanding
              your idea, replying, generating the designs you asked for, and delivering them
              to you. Photos you text to SketchBot are part of that message content: we keep
              them with the conversation and use them only as design references — to
              understand the style and subjects you are pointing at. We do not use your
              number for anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Message and data rates may apply, and message frequency varies with the
              conversation. Text <strong className="text-quiet">STOP</strong> at any time to
              opt out of further messages, or <strong className="text-quiet">HELP</strong>{" "}
              for help.

            <p>
              We have not invented retention windows to sound official. Where a period is
              not fixed by law or by the mechanics described in this policy, the rule is:
              we keep it until you delete it or ask us to.
