/**
 * Reinstatement — the one door through the takedown wall. See docs/adr/0026.
 *
 * ## The problem this solves
 *
 * ADR 0025 made a takedown permanent: a `:TakedownTombstone` keyed on the
 * Instagram handle blocks every ingest path, forever, failing closed. That is
 * correct against a re-scrape and wrong as a life sentence — an artist who had
 * TatT remove their scraped profile in 2026 must still be able to *choose* to be
 * on TatT in 2027. The owner's condition was exact: kept out **"unless they
 * signup themselves"**.
 *
 * ## The design, in one line
 *
 * **The tombstone is never lifted. The ingest gate stays shut forever.**
 *
 * Two different things were being conflated:
 *
 *   1. blocking automated, non-consensual **re-ingest** by the crawler, and
 *   2. blocking **the person** from ever using TatT.
 *
 * A tombstone should only ever mean (1). So reinstatement does not knock a hole
 * in the wall; it opens a different door — a consented, identity-checked
 * self-signup that binds the profile to the artist. `TOMBSTONE_KEYS_CYPHER` keeps
 * returning the key afterwards and `filterTombstoned` keeps rejecting it.
 *
 * Leaving the gate shut is not merely safe, it is *better*: once the artist owns
 * their profile, a later crawl finding their handle must not overwrite what they
 * wrote with scraped data. Permanent suppression of the scrape path is the
 * correct end state for a reinstated artist, not a compromise.
 *
 * ## Reinstatement restores nothing, and cannot
 *
 * The executor hard-deleted the photographs from GCS and the embedding from
 * Supabase, and scrubbed name, bio, handle, location and portfolio off the node
 * (ADR 0025 §1–2). What survives is an id-keyed husk. Clearing `removedAt`
 * therefore yields an **empty profile** bound to the artist's uid, which they
 * then fill in themselves — with their consent, from their own hands.
 *
 * This is a structural property, not a policy: there is no code path by which
 * reinstatement can bring back scraped content, because the scraped content no
 * longer exists. It is why reinstatement can be offered at all.
 *
 * ## What proves it is really them
 *
 * The wall exists to protect people, so the door must be harder to walk through
 * than the wall was to build. Takedown requires: a public form, no account, then
 * a human. Reinstatement requires all of:
 *
 *   1. **A signed-in account.** Deliberately asymmetric with takedown, which
 *      requires none — asking to be *removed* must be frictionless; asking to be
 *      *re-added* must not be. It also gives the binding an identity to revoke.
 *   2. **Proof of control of the tombstoned Instagram handle**, via a one-time
 *      code the requester publishes on that account. The tombstone is keyed on
 *      the handle and, for this dataset, the handle *is* the identity — so the
 *      proof is anchored to the same fact the removal was.
 *   3. **A human.** Same restraint as takedown: the request route has no write
 *      path to the tombstone or the Artist node. A wall built by a human decision
 *      comes down by a human decision.
 *
 * Honest limits are in ADR 0026 §"Attack surface" — chiefly that this does not
 * survive a hijacked Instagram account, and has no anchor at all for an artist
 * whose tombstone carries no handle.
 *
 * ## Why this does not sit on top of the claim flow
 *
 * Issue #192: `/api/v1/connect/claim` binds `claimedByUid` — the key the money
 * path trusts — to whoever calls it first, with **no identity check at all**.
 * Reinstatement therefore never calls it. It performs its own binding, after
 * handle-control proof and human review, and refuses outright when the husk is
 * already claimed by a different uid (that is #192 surfacing, and it must not be
 * auto-resolved).
 *
 * The converse leak is closed in `/api/v1/connect/claim` itself, which now
 * refuses removed artists — otherwise the unverified route would be a way around
 * this one, since the husk deliberately retains `stripeAccountId`.
 *
 * Everything in this module is pure. Nothing here writes anything.
