/**
 * Readiness confidence for the proposal beat (ADR-0020, ADR-0021).
 *
 * This is a transparent 0–1 score computed in code from field presence and
 * strength — NEVER a raw model number. The formula (contributions sum to
 * exactly 1.0):
 *
 *   placement present                       +0.20
 *   placement specific (names a concrete
 *     body part, not just a bare limb)      +0.10
 *   meaning OR named subject present        +0.20
 *   meaning non-trivial (>= 4 words) OR
 *     named subject                         +0.10
 *   style tags present (>= 1)               +0.20
 *   variation axes resolved                 +0.05 per resolved axis (of 4),
 *                                            up to +0.20
 *
 * This is the ADR-0023 Part 3 formula ("style tags present +0.20") — an
 * earlier version demanded TWO style tags for full credit and gave a named
 * subject no scoring weight at all, which held a live session (arm sleeve +
 * five named characters) at 0.55 while the bot looped on the same style
 * question. The gate's bias is toward generating: the reveal is the
 * questionnaire in disguise (ADR-0012), so open axes are a reason to
 * generate a spread, not to keep interrogating.
 *
 * The judgment rule fires the proposal when confidence >=
 * CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD AND the required fields are present: placement, plus
 * EITHER a meaning or a named subject. Requiring meaning outright stranded
 * complete briefs that simply had no emotional "why" — an observed session
 * gave placement, blackwork style and "goku charging a kamehameha", said
 * "thats everything", and still could not advance. A named character is a
 * concrete thing to draw, which is exactly what meaning was standing in for.
 * missingFields lists every field that earned less than full credit —
 * "missing or weak", per the TurnLog contract.
