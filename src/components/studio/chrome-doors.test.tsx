 * entered from a picked design (ADR-0038) and is never part of the main
 * journey (ADR-0017). The design library is its door: every saved cut
 * carries "Fix it in the Studio". /studio itself still answers bookmarks
 * and direct URLs — see src/app/studio/page.test.tsx — it just isn't
 * offered to people who have nothing to refine.
