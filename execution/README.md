# Execution Manifest

Maps each directive to the scripts, services, and API routes that implement it. No files were moved — this is a reference index.

## Artist discovery and quarterly refresh

The Instagram operator path is deliberately split into three auditable stages:

1. `discover_ig.py` collects and profiles possible new handles, then writes
   every accepted and rejected candidate to `data/discovery/candidates.json`.
   It requires an explicit valid `--queue`; paid collection and profiling also
   require `--execute --sweep-id <id>`. Discovery writes its own
   `apify-discovery-run-report.json` spend ledger and caches a seed, hashtag,
   or profile chunk only after the actor reaches terminal `SUCCEEDED`.
2. `apify_ig_enrich.py` refreshes known handles. The shared
   `ig_quality.py` gate is on by default; `--no-filter` is the explicit,
   audited override. The command is dry-run by default; paid actor work
   requires `--execute` and an explicit valid `--queue`. With no `--count`,
   it processes the rest of that queue rather than a hidden default slice.
3. `scripts/host-artist-images.mjs` hosts accepted images and
   `scripts/apply-artist-refresh-status.mjs` applies the separate freshness
   ledger. The status applier is dry-run by default.

The refresh distinguishes confirmed `not_found` / `private` observations from
transient actor or network failures. Three consecutive confirmed dead
observations mark an artist stale. A confirmed active profile clears stale;
transient failures never create or clear it. One sweep ID gets one observation
per handle, so retries or overlapping workers cannot manufacture the three
dead observations. A later confirmed active/dead result in the same sweep can
replace an earlier transient result. Ledger state is checkpointed only after
the profile/quarantine/audit effects complete, and audit event IDs make crash
retries idempotent.

Rejected and confirmed-dead profile files move into the local
`apify-profiles/quarantine/` directory instead of being deleted. Every
decision is appended to `refresh-audit.jsonl`. This keeps repeated runs
idempotent without destroying review evidence.

### Classifier limits

The filter is conservative but heuristic:

- A private individual artist is rejected because enrichment cannot verify
  their current work or booking signal.
- A studio bio containing “our artists,” hiring language, or multi-artist
  booking language can reject an otherwise legitimate resident artist if the
  profile itself is a shared shop account.
- Sparse bios can pass as `tattoo-artist(weak)` when they clearly identify the
  craft but provide no booking link.
- Mixed tattoo/piercing accounts and unusually worded product promotions may
  still require manual review.

Tune the shared rules in `ig_quality.py` with focused tests. Do not silently
delete rejections or maintain a second classifier in another pipeline.

### Cadence and cost gate

There is intentionally no quarterly schedule yet. Each Apify run writes
`apify-run-report.json`, including `usageTotalUsd` when Apify supplies it.
Pass one `--sweep-id` across every batch; both discovery and refresh reports
deduplicate paid attempts
and accumulate cost rather than overwriting the prior slice. The total stays
unknown when any POST outcome is ambiguous or any identified actor run is
non-terminal or lacks pricing. The report exposes the known subtotal,
missing/non-terminal/ambiguous counts, and `incomplete` status instead of
presenting a partial sum as complete. A durable ambiguous-spend checkpoint is
written before POST and updated as soon as a run ID or terminal result exists,
so a crash cannot erase paid-attempt evidence.
After the host stage, capture GCS cost from the billing export and attach both
amounts to the run record. Only schedule the sweep after one complete,
measured run has an approved spend cap. The nightly crew runner is unrelated
and must not launch this paid job.

`enrich_all.sh`, `parallel_enrich.sh`, and the compatibility
`enrich_artists.py` entrypoint all route into the audited runner. The shell
runners require `--execute`, a stable `--sweep-id`, and an explicit queue.
The parallel wrapper treats `--workers` as concurrency and schedules slices
until the whole queue is covered. Parallel processes merge the ledger and cost
report under file locks and audit-log appends are serialized. Supply
`APIFY_TOKEN` only through the process environment; both discovery and refresh
send it in an authorization header and never place it in a URL.

Refresh/import writers may update portfolio, the audited `looksBookable`
verdict/reason, and refresh-health properties only. Artist-owned profile
fields (including `artistManagedFields` and
`profileManagedAtEpochMs`) remain authoritative and must never be overwritten
by a scrape. Instagram is immutable after identity verification, and
`claimVerificationStatus` is verification state rather than scrape data.
