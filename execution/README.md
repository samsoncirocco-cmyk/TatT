# Execution Manifest

Maps each directive to the scripts, services, and API routes that implement it. No files were moved — this is a reference index.

## Artist discovery and quarterly refresh

The Instagram operator path is deliberately split into three auditable stages:

1. `discover_ig.py` collects and profiles possible new handles, then writes
   every accepted and rejected candidate to `data/discovery/candidates.json`.
2. `apify_ig_enrich.py` refreshes known handles. The shared
   `ig_quality.py` gate is on by default; `--no-filter` is the explicit,
   audited override. The command is dry-run by default; paid actor work
   requires `--execute`.
3. `scripts/host-artist-images.mjs` hosts accepted images and
   `scripts/apply-artist-refresh-status.mjs` applies the separate freshness
   ledger. The status applier is dry-run by default.

The refresh distinguishes confirmed `not_found` / `private` observations from
transient actor or network failures. Three consecutive confirmed dead
observations mark an artist stale. A confirmed active profile clears stale;
transient failures never create or clear it. One sweep ID gets one observation
per handle, so retries or overlapping workers cannot manufacture the three
dead observations.

Rejected and confirmed-dead profile files move into the local
`apify-profiles/quarantine/` directory instead of being deleted. Every
decision is appended to `refresh-audit.jsonl`. This keeps repeated runs
idempotent without destroying review evidence.

### Classifier limits

The filter is conservative but heuristic:

- A private individual artist is rejected because enrichment cannot verify
  their current work or booking signal.
- A studio bio containing “our artists,” hiring language, or multi-artist
  booking language can reject an otherwise legitimate resident artist if the
  profile itself is a shared shop account.
- Sparse bios can pass as `tattoo-artist(weak)` when they clearly identify the
  craft but provide no booking link.
- Mixed tattoo/piercing accounts and unusually worded product promotions may
  still require manual review.

Tune the shared rules in `ig_quality.py` with focused tests. Do not silently
delete rejections or maintain a second classifier in another pipeline.

### Cadence and cost gate

There is intentionally no quarterly schedule yet. Each Apify run writes
`apify-run-report.json`, including `usageTotalUsd` when Apify supplies it.
Pass one `--sweep-id` across every batch; the report deduplicates actor run IDs
and accumulates cost rather than overwriting the prior slice. The total stays
unknown when any actor run lacks pricing; the report exposes the known
subtotal, missing-run count, and `incomplete` pricing status instead of
presenting a partial sum as complete.
After the host stage, capture GCS cost from the billing export and attach both
amounts to the run record. Only schedule the sweep after one complete,
measured run has an approved spend cap. The nightly crew runner is unrelated
and must not launch this paid job.

`enrich_all.sh`, `parallel_enrich.sh`, and the compatibility
`enrich_artists.py` entrypoint all route into the audited runner. The shell
runners require both `--execute` and a stable `--sweep-id`. Parallel processes
merge the ledger and cost report under file locks and audit-log appends are
serialized. Supply `APIFY_TOKEN` only through the process environment; the
runner sends it in an authorization header and never places it in a URL.

Refresh/import writers may update portfolio, the audited `looksBookable`
verdict/reason, and refresh-health properties only. Artist-owned profile
fields (including `artistManagedFields` and
`profileManagedAtEpochMs`) remain authoritative and must never be overwritten
by a scrape. Instagram is immutable after identity verification, and
`claimVerificationStatus` is verification state rather than scrape data.
